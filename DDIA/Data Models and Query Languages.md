# Data models
### Relational Model vs Document Model
- Relational databases come from needing business data processing
- Other databases back in the day required developers to think about the arrangement of data in the database
### NoSQL
- greater scalability including very large datasets or very high write throughput
- preference for free and open source software
- specialized query operations not supported by a relational model
- to avoid the restrictiveness of a relational schema
