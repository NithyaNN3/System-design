## Reliability
- **Tolerant of 'faults'**: Works as expected even under unexpected conditions
- Failures are not the same as faults. Failures are when the system fails to provide a service itself.
- Hardware faults (like disk death, redundancy), Software errors (like slow service, software bugs), Human errors (like config errors) 

## Scalability
- Ability to cope with increased load
- 

## Maintainability
- Follows convention, standard that can be understood by future devs
